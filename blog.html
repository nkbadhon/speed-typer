                <h1>1. Differences between Local storage vs Session storage?</h1>
                <p>Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference
                    between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                    sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                    A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are
                    valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the
                    browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created
                    each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is
                    opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage
                    from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and
                    clears sessionStorage objects.</p>

                <h1>2. Differences between Global Scope vs Block Scope?</h1>
                <p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
                    controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
                    statements, and the like.</p>

                <h1>How does JS event loop works?</h1>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <p>
                    * Parameter that is not passed will give undefined. <br>
                    * If return has nothing on the right side, system will return undefined.<br>
                    * Property that does not exists of an object will return undefined.<br>
                    * Accessing array elements outside of the index range will return undefined.<br>
                    * Deleting an element inside an array
                    set a value directly to undefined.<br>
